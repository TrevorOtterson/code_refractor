This was my first time creating a repository and adding a file to it.
I was given a messy HTML and css file that needed to be cleaned up and fixed.

After I was finished cleaning the files and making them more readable I created a reposition in git hub to submit the work to.
I then used the command line to clone to repository, add my files into the repo and then commit the changes to the new repository.
